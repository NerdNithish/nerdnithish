# 👋 Hey, I’m Nithishkumar

🔐 Red Team aspirant grounded in Blue Team fundamentals.  
Currently sharpening my detection, scripting, and incident response skills — one real-world lab at a time.

### 🚩 What I'm Working On
- 🛡️ SOC Simulator labs: log poisoning, SSH brute-force, reverse shell analysis
- 🧠 Privilege escalation and rootkit forensics on Linux
- 🔧 Building a personal red team CLI toolkit in Python
- 📡 Packet Tracer simulations — network segmentation, ACL evasion, and pivoting

### 🧰 Toolbox So Far
`Linux` · `Bash` · `Python` · `Wireshark` · `tshark` · `iptables`  
`Cisco Packet Tracer` · `Reverse Shells` · `Netcat / Socat` · `Syslog Forensics`

### 🧭 My Path
I'm not rushing red teaming.  
I'm earning it — by first **becoming the Blue Team**.  
That means learning how attackers hide... so I can expose them.
